# diayalma

A new Flutter project. This application enables students on the UADB university campus to buy and sell products.
You will need to install and configure Android studio and add the flutter pluggin on android studio. Then go to setting plugin and add the path to sdk flutter on android.
Then you just need to create a new flutter project and ask the AI to give you the main.dart file which is under the lib folder and the lib subfolders to have the online shopping application. One important thing is to configure firebase by creating a project with the same name as the application and then add the application to firebase. That's for you to learn.
